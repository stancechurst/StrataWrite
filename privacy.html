  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: September 2025</em></p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy applies to <strong>StrataWrite</strong>, <strong>StrataRead</strong>, and
    <strong>StrataFeed</strong> (collectively referred to as <strong>StrataSuite</strong>),
    research-focused applications for macOS and iPadOS.
    Protecting your privacy is important. This policy explains what data these apps handle and how it is used.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    StrataWrite, StrataRead, and StrataFeed do not collect, track, sell, or transmit personal data
    to the developer.
  </p>
  <p>
    All user-created or user-managed content—including notes, manuscripts, PDFs, annotations,
    and reading lists—remains stored locally on your device or within your personal iCloud account
    if sync is enabled.
  </p>

  <h2>iCloud and Sync</h2>
  <p>
    If you enable iCloud sync in any StrataSuite app, your data is stored securely in your personal
    iCloud account. Apple manages the encryption, transmission, and storage of this data.
    The developer does not have access to your iCloud-stored content.
  </p>

  <h2>External Data Sources</h2>
  <p>
    StrataFeed retrieves publicly available scholarly metadata (such as article titles, authors,
    abstracts, and publication information) from the OpenAlex open scholarly catalog.
    These requests do not include personal identifiers and are not used for user tracking or profiling.
  </p>

  <h2>Analytics and Tracking</h2>
  <p>
    StrataSuite apps do not include third-party analytics, advertising frameworks, or tracking technologies.
  </p>

  <h2>Support Communications</h2>
  <p>
    If you contact support at <a href="mailto:stance@mac.com">stance@mac.com</a>,
    any information you provide in that email will be used solely to respond to your request
    and will not be shared or retained for other purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Rights and Control</h2>
  <p>
    You retain full control of your data. You may delete notes, manuscripts, PDFs, annotations,
    and reading data directly within the apps at any time.
  </p>
  <p>
    If iCloud sync is enabled, related data stored in iCloud can be managed or deleted
    through your Apple ID iCloud settings in accordance with Apple’s policies.
  </p>
